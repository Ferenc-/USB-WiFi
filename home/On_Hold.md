Review of user comments by @morrownr : User reports so far are positive with the exception of one user finding a driver error in AP mode but he has submitted a PATCH to correct the situation. One of the advantages this adapter and the Alfa AXM adapter has over the other listed adapters in this section is that it has removable antennas which allow users to install directional antennas for longer range if so desired. Rokland keeps directional antennas for this adapter in stock. This adapter also appears to have no thermal issues at all and it has a VERY NICE extension cable that can plug into USB3-A and USB3-C ports.

Review by @morrownr : I now have this adapter. My thoughts: This adapter is much smaller than most "football goal" style adapters and it is stylish (cute). The quality appears to be above average. It is showing an average of 525 Mbps in managed mode testing with iperf3. Testing was accomplish on channel 100 DFS (no other APs on the channel) and distance of about 10 meters with 3 walls. Extended iperf3 testing results is less than average heat buildup and the single most impressive thing is the range. This is not called a "High "Power" or "Max Power" adapter as Alfa likes to call its extended range adapters, but it has excellent range. So far, this adapter has exceeded my expectations. Antennas are removable. No extension cable/stand is included.

Overall: If you are looking for a rtl8812bu based adapter that has good performance and excellent range, this adapter should be work well for you.
