## Recommended Bluetooth Adapters for Linux

I have started this list because of my strong recommendation to Linux users to avoid USB WiFi adapters that include bluetooth support. I have seen too many problems with combo adapters over the years. There are technical reasons for the problems that users see with combo adapters. I will explain this in detail on this page as I have time. It will take some time for this page to become as useful as we need and I could certainly use a partner to maintain this page. If interested, leave me a message in Issues.
